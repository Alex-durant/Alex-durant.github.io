        <p>Hi I'm Alex! This is my last semester at Asnuntuck before I transfer to UCONN. 
        I only have this class and three others to go! I am currently working towards
        an associates in Communications: Broadcasting, but my goal is to get a job in
        animal care. I have lived with both dogs and cats, but I also want to learn 
        more about reptiles, anphibians, and larger mammals. I realized this was what
        I wanted to devote my life to two years ago after helping a friend rehabilitate
        a sick and previously feral cat. Experiencing her growth firsthand was an extremely
        rewarding experience. I enjoy learning and am always looking forward to furthering 
        my knowledge on any given topic. One of my main hobbies is discovering everything I 
        can about fictional stories conveyed through liturature, video games, and television.
        I try to participate in as many creative events that celebrate such media as I can.</p>
